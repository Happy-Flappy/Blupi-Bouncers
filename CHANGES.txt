1: DPI detection was glitchy. Now fixed and code cleaned up.

2: Transparent windows for supposedly as far back as windows 2000. (Used UpdateLayeredWindow() function)

3: Overall, more cleanliness and orderliness of code.

4: Added user control "settings.txt" to change blupi's scale or switch transparency methods if first method fails. 
	1 = Modern method
	0 = Old method(more reliable but slower)
5: Changed Exit Key Combo from Ctrl+Alt+Esc to simply Ctrl+Esc.
 
6: Update sizes to account for mid-use changing of the global DPI:

7: Optimized legacy transparency method by cutting out frame by frame color conversion from RGBA to BGRA. 

8: Color conversion is now done once to graphics at program start.
